550,where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
551,where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
552,and the executioner s face is always well hidden
553,where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten
554,where black is the color where none is the number
555,and i ll tell and speak it and think it and breathe it
556,and reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it

1315,with his friend a jealous monk
1316,now he looked so immaculately frightful
1317,as he bummed a cigarette
1318,then he went off sniffing drainpipes
1319,and reciting the alphabet
1320,you would not think to look at him
1321,but he was famous long ago
1322,for playing the electric violin
1323,on desolation row
1324,dr filth he keeps his world
1325,inside of a leather cup
1326,but all his sexless patients
1327,they are trying to blow it up
1328,now his nurse some local loser
1329,she s in charge of the cyanide hole
1330,and she also keeps the cards that read
1331,have mercy on his soul
1332,they all play on the penny whistle
1333,you can hear them blow
1334,if you lean your head out far enough
1335,from desolation row

1339,in a perfect image of a priest
1340,they are spoon feeding casanova
1341,to get him to feel more assured
1342,then they ll kill him with self confidence
1343,after poisoning him with words
1344,and the phantom s shouting to skinny girls
1345,get outta here if you don t know
1346,casanova is just being punished for going
1347,to desolation row
1348,at midnight all the agents
1349,and the superhuman crew
1350,come out and round up everyone
1351,that knows more than they do
1352,then they bring them to the factory
1353,where the heart attack machine
1354,is strapped across their shoulders
1355,and then the kerosene
1356,is brought down from the castles
1357,by insurance men who go
1358,check to see that nobody is escaping
1359,to desolation row
1360,praise be to nero s neptune

1619,use your arms and legs it won t ruin you
1620,how can you say he will haunt you
1621,you can go back to him any time you want to
1622,he looks so truthful is this how he feels
1623,trying to peel the moon and expose it
1624,with his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
1625,if he needs a third eye he just grows it
1626,he just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
1627,or pick it up after he throws it
1628,can you please crawl out your window
1629,use your arms and legs it won t ruin you
1630,how can you say he will haunt you
1631,you can go back to him any time you want to
1632,why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
1633,are you frightened of the box you keep him in
1634,while his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
1635,their religion of the little tin women
1636,that backs up their views but your face is so bruised
1637,come on out the dark is beginning
1638,can you please crawl out your window
1639,use your arms and legs it won t ruin you
1640,how can you say he will haunt you
1641,you can go back to him any time you want to
1642,i once loved a girl her skin it was bronze
1643,with the innocence of a lamb she was gentle like a fawn
1644,i courted her proudly but now she is gone
1645,gone as the season she s taken
1646,through young summer s breeze i stole her away
1647,from her mother and sister though close did they stay
1648,each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
1649,with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us
1650,of the two sister i loved the young
1651,with sensitive instincts she was the creative one
1652,the constant scapegoat she was easily undone
1653,by the jealousy of others around her
1654,for her parasite sister i had no respect
1655,bound by her boredom her pride to protect
1656,countless visions of the other she d reflect
1657,as a crutch for her scenes and her society
1658,myself for what i did i cannot be excused
1659,the changes i was going through can t even be used
1660,for the lies that i told her in hopes not to lose
1661,the could be dream lover of my lifetime
1662,with unseen consciousness i possessed in my grip
1663,a magnificent mantelpiece though its heart being chipped
1664,noticing not that i d already slipped
1665,to a sin of love s false security
1666,from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
1667,answers of emptiness voice vacancies
1668,till the tombstones of damage read me no question but please
1669,what s wrong and what s exactly the matter
1670,and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
1671,the timeless explosion of fantasy s dream
1672,at the peak of the night the king and the queen
1673,tumbled all down into pieces
1674,the tragic figure her sister did shout
1675,leave her alone god damn you get out
1676,and i in my armor turning about
1677,and nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness
1678,beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
1679,her sister and i in a screaming battleground
1680,and she in between the victim of sound
1681,soon shattered as a child to the shadows
1682,all is gone all is gone admit it take flight
1683,i gagged in contradiction tears blinding my sight
1684,my mind it was mangled i ran into the night
1685,leaving all of love s ashes behind me
1686,the wind knocks my window the room it is wet
1687,the words to say i m sorry i haven t found yet
1688,i think of her often and hope whoever she s met
1689,will be fully aware of how precious she is
1690,ah my friends from the prison they ask unto me
1691,how good how good does it feel to be free
1692,and i answer them most mysteriously
1693,are birds free from the chains of the skyway
1694,well it s all of a fair and a handsome girl
1695,she s all in her tender years
1696,she fell in love with a sailor boy
1697,it s true she loved him well
1698,for to go off to sea with him
1699,like she did not now how
1700,she longed to see that seaport town
1701,of canadee i o
1702,so he bargained with the sailor boy
1703,all for a piece of gold
1704,straightaway then he led her
1705,down into the hold
1706,sayin i ll dress you up in sailor s clothes
1707,your jacket shall be blue
1708,you ll see that seaport town
1709,of canadee i o
1710,now when the other sailors heard the news
1711,well they fell into a rage
1712,and with all the ship s company
1713,they were willing to engage
1714,sayin we ll tie her hands and feet my boys
1715,overboard we ll throw her
1716,she ll never see that seaport town
1717,called canadee i o
1718,now when the captain he heard the news
1719,well he too fell in rage
1720,and with the whole ships company
1721,he was willing to engage
1722,sayin she ll stay all in sailor s clothes
1723,her color shall be blue
1724,she ll see that seaport town
1725,called canadee i o
1726,now when they come down to canada
1727,scarcely bout half a year
1728,she s married this bold captain
1729,who called her his dear
1730,she s dressed in silks and satins now
1731,she cuts a gallant show
1732,finest of the ladies
1733,down canadee i o
1734,come all you fair and tender girls
1735,wheresoever you may bee
1736,i d have you to follow your own true love
1737,whene er he goes to sea
1738,for the sailors prove false to you
1739,well the captain he might prove true
1740,you ll see the honor i have gained
1741,by the wearing of the blue
